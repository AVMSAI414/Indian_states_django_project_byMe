    <h1 ><u>History:</u></h1>
    <blockquote>
    <h3><b>Andhra Pradesh</b>, A state of India, located in the southeastern part of the subcontinent. It is bounded by the Indian states of Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the southwest and west, Telangana to the northwest and north, and Odisha to the northeast.The state draws its name from the Andhra people, who have inhabited the area since antiquity and developed their own language, Telugu. Andhra Pradesh came into existence in its present form in 1956 as a result of the demand of the Andhras for a separate state. Although it is primarily agricultural, the state has some mining activity and a significant amount of industry</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <h3>After India gained independence in 1947, however, the region remained administratively and linguistically divided. In 1950 the southern and eastern Andhra portion was incorporated into Madras state, and the Telangana region became part of Hyderabad state. The Andhras’ demand for separate statehood became so insistent that, when the central government refused to comply, a local leader, Potti Sreeramulu, fasted to death in 1952 to dramatize the issue. The government finally acceded to the people’s request by creating, on October 1, 1953, Andhra state, which included the Telugu-speaking districts of the former Madras state to the south. That action paved the way for the formation of linguistic states throughout India, beginning in 1956 and continuing into the 21st century. Through the States Reorganization Act of 1956, the state of Hyderabad was split up, and its Telugu-speaking districts (constituting Telangana) were joined to the Andhra state on November 1, 1956, to form the new state of Andhra Pradesh.</h3>
    
    </blockquote><h3>Andhra Pradesh has a long and illustrious history. Famous Indian epics like the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Jataka Tales, and Puranas all make reference to it. The several distinct kingdoms that have controlled the area have contributed to Andhra Pradesh's great heritage. Andhra Pradesh history has contributed in evolving the culture and traditions thathave been greatly influenced by the kings. After much struggle, 11 districts of the former Madras State eventually created the State of Andhra Pradesh on October 1, 1953, with Kurnool serving as its capital. </h3>

    <h1 ><u>Land:</u></h1>
    <h3>The state has three main physiographic regions:
    <ol>
        <li> the coastal plain to the east, extending from the Bay of Bengal to the mountain ranges.</li>
        <li>the mountain ranges themselves, the Eastern Ghats, which form the western flank of the coastal plain.</li>
        <li>in the southwest, the plateau to the west of the Ghats.</li>
    </ol></h3>
    <h3>The coastal plain, also known as the Andhra region, runs almost the entire length of the state and is watered by several rivers, flowing from west to east through the hills into the bay. The deltas formed by the most important of those rivers—the Godavari and the Krishna—make up the central part of the plains, an area of fertile alluvial soil.</h3>
    <h3>The Eastern Ghats are part of a larger mountain system extending from central India to the far south and running parallel to the east coast. Interrupted by the great river valleys, the mountains do not form a continuous range. They have highly porous soils on their flanks.</h3>

    <h3>The plateau region in the southwestern portion of the state—part of the Deccan (peninsular India) and commonly called Rayalaseema—is composed of gneissic rock (gneiss being a foliated rock formed in Earth’s interior under conditions of heat and pressure). It is highest in the far southwest, where elevations exceed 2,000 feet (600 metres), sloping downward toward the northeast. The Penneru River forms the main drainage system. As the result of erosion, the plateau is a region of graded valleys, with red sandy soil and isolated hills. Black soil is also found in certain parts of the area.</h3>

    <h1><u>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</u></h1>
    <h3>Agriculture, dominated by the production of food grains, is a major, although declining, sector of the state’s economy, in terms of value. Andhra Pradesh is one of the leading rice-growing states in the country and is a major producer of India’s tobacco. The state’s rivers—particularly the Godavari and the Krishna, but also the Penneru—account for its agricultural importance.Rice flour, rice-bran oil, paints and varnishes, soaps and detergents, cardboard and other packaging materials, and cattle feed are all produced from local paddy rice. Other agricultural commodities grown statewide include other cereal grains, pulses (peas, beans, and lentils), peanuts (groundnuts), corn (maize), and cotton—all of which are processed locally as well—and a variety of fruits and vegetables.</h3>

    <h3>Animal husbandry has increased significantly in Andhra Pradesh, especially since the start of the 21st century. Livestock raising contributes roughly half as much in overall value as crop production. Animals raised include cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Dairy and egg production have grown dramatically.</h3>

    <h3>With its long coastline and many rivers, the state has a significant and expanding fishing industry. Much of the yield is drawn from freshwater and marine aquaculture, but open-sea fisheries are significant as well. Prawns and shrimp are among the main products of the industry.</h3>

    <h1><u>Services:</u></h1>
    <h3>The service sector is the largest component of Andhra Pradesh’s economy, accounting for more than half of its value. Banking and insurance, communications, and public administration are the three major components, with other services (including tourism-related activities) constituting the remainder of the value. Tourism has grown in importance, with visitors being drawn to the state’s Hindu and Buddhist cultural landmarks, natural areas in the mountains and elsewhere, and vibrant cities.</h3>
    <h3>There are several airports in the state, notably at Vijayawada, Tirupati, and Visakhapatnam. An extensive road and rail system connects Andhra Pradesh with most other parts of India. Bus transportation, a large share of which is privately operated, offers facilities for express travel between various cities. The river canals in coastal areas, especially the saltwater Kommamur (Buckingham) Canal running parallel to the coast from the Krishna River south to Chennai (Madras) in Tamil Nadu, are used for cargo transportation. Visakhapatnam is a major international seaport.</h3>

    <h1><u>Food:</u></h1>
    <h3>Andhra Pradesh is known for its spicy food all around the country. The inspiration behind such delicious variations of food lies in the opulent culture of the state, where exotic food is being prepared in the kitchen of the Nawabs since the year of its origin. The Andhra cuisine comprises of both mouth-watering vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The famous Hyderabadi dishes include appetising Biryanis, delectable rice and some tangy pickles and chutneys.</h3>

    <h3>The regions of Coastal Andhra (including Uttarandhra and Dakshinandhra), and Rayalaseema all produce distinctive variations of Andhra cuisine. Rice is the staple in the irrigated regions of Andhra and Rayalaseema. Ragi (రాగి) is also popular in Rayalaseema and Palnadu. The curries, snacks, and sweets produced in these areas vary in both name and method of preparation from region to region.</h3>

    <h3>Andhra Pradesh is the leading producer of red chili and rice in India. The concentration of red chili production in Andhra Pradesh has led to the liberal use of spices in Andhra cuisine. Vegetarian dishes, as well as meat, and seafood in coastal areas, feature prominently. Tomato pappu, gongura, and tamarind are widely used for cooking curries. Spicy and hot varieties of pickles are also an important part of Andhra cuisine, including avakaya (ఆవకాయ). "Deltaic" cuisine from Guntur in Coastal Andhra is known as the spiciest variety of Andhra cuisine, primarily because of the use of red chilis traditionally grown in the region.</h3>
